\section*{Sprint Overview}
During this sprint we worked on getting dataflow moving between all the different parts of our project. We created a middleman project that contains the model and data access code for the web application and web API to share. The middle man project was important, because without it we would have  the same endpoint code in the web application and the web API. We decided to create this middle man project to maximize code reuse. \newline

\noindent Also a great amount of progress was completed for the tablet application in this sprint. The tablet application now can actually make Http get requests and pull down seeded data from the Azure database. The tablet application uses Retrofit for making the Http requests from the Azure web API.

\section*{Setbacks}
\subsection{Tablet Application Development Change}

Here's a list of a few things that we struggled with this sprint:

\begin{itemize}
\item Database seeding and migrations problems (didn't understand how they work)
\item Tablet application retrofit requests took a while to understand and get working
\item GUID usage
\item Database permissions and authorization
\end{itemize}

\section*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Making a get request to an Azure server from the tablet application and getting JSON returned
\item Displaying JSON calendar events on the tablet application screen
\item Understand tablet class layout
\item Return actual JSON from web API endpoints
\item Updated getByOwner endpoint
\item Updated web API models
\item Understand GUID principles 
\item Load events from database
\item Connect web application database to Azure
\item Created middle man project for Web application and web API to share
\item Display calendar events on the calendar framework on the web application
\end{itemize}
