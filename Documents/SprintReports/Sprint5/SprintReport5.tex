\section*{Sprint Overview}
In this sprint, we wanted to focus on testing and getting calendar events to move back and forth between the database in the cloud and the tablet app. We were able to get a large portion of the testing done, and we were also able to achieve getting calendar events to move between the database and the tablet app. Event creation and deletion from the web app is working as well. Looking forward to the next sprint, we will try and get the authentication portion of this project completed. We would also like to be able to switch between different calendar views in the future as well.
