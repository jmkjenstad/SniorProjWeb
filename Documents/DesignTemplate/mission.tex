\section{Mission Statement}
Our team's mission is to become competent in tools that are commonly used in the software workplace and produce a product that helps close the gap in communication between professors, students, and classroom events. We want a product to streamline the planning and synchronization of people's schedules. 

\section{Elevator Pitch}
Our idea is to hang a digital sign on the outside of faculty and classroom doors. This concept would be accompanied by a mobile application.\footnote{See Appendix \ref{FutureAppendix}} This would allow us to display a schedule of weekly events, allow the student to view these events, and allow student interactions. This could be useful in situations such as a faculty member being ill and needs to remotely update their schedule and inform their students quickly that class is canceled. In addition, students could view classroom event schedules and request to reserve a classroom.
