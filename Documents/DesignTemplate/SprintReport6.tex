\section*{Sprint Overview}
In this sprint, we wanted to focus on finishing the getby endpoints so the tablet could view the calendar events based on a given calendar.  We got endpoints created to get all the calendar events in the database filtered by a range and a room or range and a faculty member. The tablet is able to log in using token based authentication, choose a calendar to view, and view all the events based on what was chosen. On the Web App part of the project, we wanted to register and distinguish between certain roles. We are now able to know whether a faculty member or a student logs in.  A lot of work was done updating the database models.  The models needed to be broken up into separate tables. References needed to be created between tables in the database.
